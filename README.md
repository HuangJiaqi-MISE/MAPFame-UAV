# MAPFame-UAV

This is a warehouse inventory management simulation system based on machine vision technology. The system can import different vision algorithms to automatically scan the entire warehouse in a 3D simulation environment, and upload the warehouse information to the dashboard in real-time for monitoring and management, helping customers quickly locate and solve inventory discrepancy issues, while greatly reducing labor and time investment.

## Project Background

Traditional warehouse inventory counting work usually requires a lot of manpower and time investment, and also easily leads to inventory discrepancies. In order to solve these problems, we have designed and developed this machine vision-based drone inventory counting simulation system.

## Core Functions

1. **3D Simulation Environment**: The system supports importing warehouse 3D models and simulating autonomous drone inspection and scanning in the simulation environment.
2. **Intelligent Vision Algorithms**: The system integrates various vision algorithms to achieve automatic identification and counting of warehouse goods.
3. **Real-time Monitoring and Management**: The scanning results are uploaded to the dashboard in real-time, and customers can quickly view inventory information and locate and solve discrepancy issues.
4. **Task Allocation and Path Planning**: Supports automatic task allocation and optimal path planning for drones to improve scanning efficiency.

## Technical Features

1. **Machine Vision Technology**: Utilize computer vision and deep learning algorithms to achieve automatic identification and counting of goods.
2. **3D Simulation Engine**: Developed based on the Unity 3D engine, which can simulate real warehouse environments and drone flights.
3. **Cloud-based Data Management**: Upload scanning data to the cloud in real-time, supporting multi-user collaboration and data sharing.
4. **Intelligent Scheduling Algorithm**: Adopt heuristic-based path planning algorithms to automatically allocate drone tasks and improve scanning efficiency.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MAPFame-UAV.git
